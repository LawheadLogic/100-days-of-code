# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked through SAS Essentials, Lesson 3, took quiz, started to apply to new data

**Thoughts:** I have been working through the SAS Essentials course and today I completed lesson 3. I was confused at first because the quiz appeared to have things I didn't know, but it turns out I had missed a lot of the lessons. (*Shrug*). In order to better learn the skills, I am applying them to a new data set I found through open data sources. I just started this process so the code will continue to change.
