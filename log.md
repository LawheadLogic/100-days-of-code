# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 19, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Worked through SAS Essentials, Lesson 3, took quiz, started to apply to new data

**Thoughts:** I have been working through the SAS Essentials course and today I completed lesson 3. I was confused at first because the quiz appeared to have things I didn't know, but it turns out I had missed a lot of the lessons. (*Shrug*). In order to better learn the skills, I am applying them to a new data set I found through open data sources. I just started this process so the code will continue to change.

### Day 2: January 20, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started SAS Programming 1:Essentials, Lesson 4. Got Approx 50% through it.
**Thoughts:** I started to rush at points in this and it was very ineffective. It was a good reminder to slow down.

### Day 3: January 21, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Finished Lesson 4 and took the quiz

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed working with the conditional processings statements in sas. The If/Then/Do or the Select/Where are huge to be able to split out data and analyze it. I am excited to apply that to the fire data tomorrow to start looking at the different types of calls and potentially start combining some of the calls.

### Day 4: January 22, 2022

**Today's Progress**: Started Lesson 5, started to get into plotting

**Thoughts:** Today was fun. It is the beginning of actually building reports with graphics. I am excited to start working on my own data set to apply all of this. The goal is to finish the SAS Programming 1 course, and then apply everything I learned on 1-2 datasets.
